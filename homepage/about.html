            My name is Clara Medina and I'm a senior at NEST+m high school. I'm going to be a freshman at Wesleyan University next year and I hope to do a double major in Computer Science and Science in Society with a minor in theater/film. In my free time I like to act, read a lot of books, create my own films, and watch a ton of movies.
