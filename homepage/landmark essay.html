                    <h1>"Write Your New York"</h1>
                    In “Here is New York,” E.B. White describes New York’s many vibrant communities that exist in the many small spaces within this large metropolis.  With so many people nestled into so few blocks, any given neighborhood has a myriad of micro-communities that each have their own look and feel, their own little climate or culture.  In “City Limits,” Colson Whitehead goes even further to explore how each New Yorker has his or her own private New York built brick by brick from experiences of interacting in the city.  He concludes that we must cherish the places of our private New York because they are like landmarks to our identities as we grow and change with the city; this city has helped create each one of us, and the city and our “selves” are inextricably intertwined. So here we are - each of us will write our own homage to our own New York.

                    <h1>Objective</h1>
                    The purpose of this project is to describe one everyday landmark or event that represents an aspect of your New York. What landmark or event is inextricably linked to “Your New York” and who you are as a New Yorker?  This is not a tourist landmark, but a New Yorker’s landmark - could be a block, a bodega, a park, etc.  In this project, you will write a feature article that identifies and describes a singular place in New York City that you think has its own little culture, its own climate, that in some way, big or small, is a part of “Your New York.”  Your piece must have a clear “Central Idea” that expresses the value or significance of this place, because it represents Your New York and who you are as a New Yorker.  To build this piece you will use several “Methods of Development” and develop a clear tone that aligns with your central idea through your use of Diction, Imagery, Details, and Language.  Ultimately, it must be authentic, something your friends/family would embrace as true about your New York.
